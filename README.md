### CPU Scheduling Algorithms in go

This repository contains the implementation of the following CPU scheduling algorithms in go:

- Shortest Job First (SJF)
- Round Robin (RR)

### How to run the code

1. Clone the repository
2. Navigate to the directory where the code is located
3. Run the following command to run the code:

```bash
go run *.go
```

### While running the code

- You will be asked to select the scheduling algorithm you want to run
- You will be asked to enter the number of processes you want to run
- You will be asked if you want to enter the process details manually or randomly generate them
- You will be asked to enter the time quantum for the Round Robin algorithm

### Output

The output will be displayed on the terminal. The output will contain a table that shows the process details and the waiting time for each process.
